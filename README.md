Project outline

Project Overview:
A full-stack web application designed to help students manage their coursework. The main features include:

Calendar Creation and Management.
Google Calendar Integration for syncing deadlines and events.
AI-powered Chatbot to assist with studying.

1. Set Up Project Structure:
Create the Project Structure:
Front-End: Use React (or Vue.js) to build dynamic, component-based views.
Back-End: Use Node.js with Express.js to build RESTful APIs.
Database: Use MongoDB for storing user data, courses, assignments, etc.
Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 for Google account authentication.
Resource:
React Documentation
Node.js Documentation
MongoDB Documentation
OAuth 2.0 Guide

3. User Authentication and Profile Management:
Authentication Flow:
Implement Google OAuth 2.0 to allow users to log in with their Google account.
Set up JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication to ensure secure session management.
Profile Management:
Create user profiles where students can input and edit basic information (e.g., name, email, courses).
Optionally store profile data in MongoDB.

5. Creating and Managing Coursework Calendars:
Calendar Interface:

Use libraries like FullCalendar.js or React Calendar to allow users to visually manage and view their coursework.
Allow users to add, update, and delete course events, assignments, and exams.
Google Calendar Sync:

Integrate Google Calendar API using OAuth 2.0 authentication to allow users to sync their coursework with Google Calendar.
Provide functionality to add, edit, and delete events in the user’s Google Calendar.

FullCalendar.js Documentation
React Calendar Documentation
Google Calendar API Documentation
OAuth 2.0 Authentication for Google Calendar

4. Implementing the Study Assistance Chatbot:
Designing the Chatbot:

Use a pre-built AI platform like Dialogflow (by Google) or Rasa to create the chatbot.
Define intents, responses, and entities to provide useful study-related assistance (e.g., reminders, study tips).
Integrating the Chatbot:

Embed the chatbot in the front-end using an iframe, JavaScript SDK, or a React component.
Ensure that the chatbot interacts with coursework deadlines, offering reminders and assistance based on the user’s data.

Dialogflow Tutorial
Rasa Documentation
How to Integrate Dialogflow with a Web App

5. Database Design (MongoDB):
Models:
User: Contains user profile data (name, email, linked Google account).
Course: Stores information about courses (course name, professor, schedule).
Assignments/Exams: Stores information about assignments and exams, including deadlines and priority.
Chatbot Interaction: Logs user-chatbot interactions (for improving suggestions and reminders).
Relationships:
One user can have many courses, assignments, and exams.

MongoDB Schema Design
Mongoose Documentation for MongoDB

7. Google Calendar Integration:
Google OAuth Authentication:

Implement OAuth 2.0 for seamless Google account login.
Google Calendar API Operations:

Use the Google Calendar API to sync coursework events with Google Calendar.
Allow bi-directional sync (i.e., changes made in the app update Google Calendar and vice versa).
Handling Calendar Events:

Enable users to create, update, and delete calendar events through both the web app and Google Calendar.
Resources:

Google API Client for Node.js

7. Front-End Features:
Dashboard:

Display a summary of coursework deadlines and upcoming events.
Create a clean, user-friendly interface using Material UI or Bootstrap for the layout.
Calendar View:

Allow users to add courses and manage deadlines using a visual calendar.
Use dynamic forms to input coursework data and render the calendar events.
Chatbot Interface:

Integrate the chatbot in a sidebar or pop-up chat window on the dashboard.
Resources:

Material UI
Bootstrap Documentation
React Chatbot Integration

8. Back-End Features:
Course Management API:

Build CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing courses, assignments, and exams.
Google Calendar Sync API:

Build endpoints that interact with the Google Calendar API to sync coursework events.
Chatbot Data Management:

Provide APIs for storing and retrieving chatbot interactions (e.g., log a user’s study queries or reminders).
Resources:

Express.js Documentation
Node.js API Development Guide

9. Testing:
Unit Testing:

Test API endpoints (e.g., course creation, Google calendar sync) using tools like Jest or Mocha.
Integration Testing:

Test Google Calendar synchronization (i.e., check if changes are reflected in real-time across both the app and Google Calendar).
User Testing:

Conduct user testing to ensure that the chatbot is providing useful assistance and the calendar interface is intuitive.
Resources:

Jest Testing Framework
Mocha Testing Framework
Google Calendar API Unit Testing

10. Deployment:
Front-End:

Deploy the front-end using Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3 for static site hosting.
Back-End:

Host the back-end using Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for API deployment.
Google OAuth Configuration:

Set up OAuth credentials in the Google Developer Console for secure access to Google Calendar.
Resources:

11. Future Features & Enhancements:
Mobile App:

Extend the functionality by developing a mobile app using React Native or Flutter.
Advanced Chatbot:

Incorporate machine learning to improve chatbot responses (e.g., offering personalized study schedules or resources).
Real-time Collaboration:

Allow students to collaborate on assignments using WebSockets or Socket.IO for real-time communication.
Analytics Dashboard:

Provide data visualization of study habits, upcoming tasks, or course performance.
Resources:

React Native Documentation
Socket.IO Tutorial
Google Analytics Integration
